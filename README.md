# Applied Mathematics Notes

Notes taken from the courses "Matemáticas Aplicadas" from ICESI University.

This subject is about calculus and linear algebra, it mainly focuses on the applications of math in the real world, specifically how to solve engineering problems through math or the math behind known solutions.

The main difference of these courses with the regular calculus and linear algebra courses is that we use [python](https://www.python.org/) inside [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to test and view big problems which doing them by hand would take days, e.g. matrix multiplication, numerical integration techniques, etc.

I've tried my best to organize my notes into folders ([I](./I), [II](./II), [III](./III), [IV](./IV)), one for each course.

Here's a summary of the topics covered by each course:

## _Matemáticas Aplicadas I_
    
The [first course](./I) covers limits, series, sequences, differentiation and its applications: optimization and rate of change, and a tiny bit of integration, specifically the concept of integration and numerical integration methods, more of these.

## _Matemáticas Aplicadas II_

The [second course](./II) covers integration techniques, separable differential equations, vectors, matrixes, multivariable functions and some multivariable calculus: partial and directional derivatives, surface integrals. It also covers the applications of these concepts in engineering problems.

## _Matemáticas Aplicadas III_

I will take the [third course](./III) on the second semester of 2024. I believe it focuses on linear algebra and multivariable calculus.

## _Matemáticas Aplicadas IV_

I will take the [fourth course](./IV) on the first semester of 2025. I believe it focuses on differential equations. My majors don't require me to take this course, but I'm interested in it because of my passion for math.
